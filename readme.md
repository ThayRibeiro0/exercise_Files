# React.js Essential Training - Linkedlin course

### Use
I download the project and open the html in the browser to see the project.
I use the vscode to write the codes and to work with codes that its not supported in browser I used Babel in Try it out and copy and pasta the code there to use in the project and to it work I put the script below also and here the link of the website: https://babeljs.io/
<script src="https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6/babel.min.js"></script>

Commands that help:

ctrl + command + space --> Emoji box
option + command + j --> shortcut to open the developer tools in the browser

Have options in cloud like to edit your code:
-  CODESANDBOX: https://codesandbox.io/s/react-new
- CODEPEN: https://codepen.io/
- GLITCH: https://glitch.com/

<!-- 
run in the terminal to this project:
### `npm install`
### `npm run dev` -->

***Have the extension `ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets` and time rafce inside the componet that will apear in the screen only need select that will great the component easier to use will help a lot in the creation of the components of this project.***

***And updates in real time to see the change that you'll do use the link `<script src="https://livejs.com/live.js"></script>` in you index.html below the meta and link.***

## Deploy projects
Create new repository in Githib with the same name of this project `nomeoftheproject` save like public to others people can see and follow the instructions of the github.
Open the project and terminal and run `git init`, readme create you same then jump and run `git add .`, after `git commit -m "Message commit that you would like put here"`, git branch -M main, copy and pasta the `git remove add origin url` that appear in the git with the url to dont have error and `git push -u origin main` after this upload the page and you can see the project in the github.

To work with github pages install `npm i gh-pages -save-dev` and package.json add:
<username>.github.io/<repositoryname>
"predeploy": "npm run build",
"deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"

and in vite.config.js:
base: "/repositoryname"

after this run `npm run deploy` if run without error works, then its only go to github pages and wait appear the link and you can share your project with others users.
